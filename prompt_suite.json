The process occurs in two stages: the light-dependent reactions, which require sunlight and take place in the thylakoid membranes, and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle), which occur in the stroma and use the products of the light reactions to fix carbon dioxide into glucose. This process is fundamental to life on Earth as it provides the oxygen we breathe and forms the base of most food chains.",
